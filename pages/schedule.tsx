    <h2>World Pride 2021 kick-off</h2>
    <p>
      During the conference, we will host a special nightclub event on the
      Saturday at Rockefeller Concert Hall, a four story building with a
      capacity of 2000 people. This will be a closing Party and kickoff for
      WorldPride 2021 in Copenhagen.
    </p>
    <p>
      All conference attendees will have free entry to the event and receive
      drink vouchers. The event is inspired by our closing night which we have
      hosted on the parade day every year since 1982.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to giving the conference attendees a good night out, the event
      will also be a major source of income for Oslo Pride enabling us to
      balance our budget. The club event has been sold out each year Oslo Pride
      have hosted it and we are confident that it will be yet another success
      during InterPride AGM.
